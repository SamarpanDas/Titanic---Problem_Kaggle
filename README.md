# Titanic—Problem_Kaggle

My attempt at the Kaggle Titanic Problem. 



We all are familiar with the tragic Titanic voyage that ended with a lot of lives lost. The Titanic was a luxurious cruise that met with an accident right on its maiden voyage.

In this project you are given the data set involving the details of the passengers and told if they survived or not. 

The training data consists of all the above details and the test data doesn’t not consists of the survived column and you are asked to predict that, convert the output in a CSV file and post it in their submission window. 


I have used Scikit - Learn as the machine learning library in Python for trying out various models for a higher accuracy.

I have used Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Classifier and Neural Networks for modelling. Neural Networks with various architectures have been tried and I have given special attentions in tuning the hyper parameters specially the Learning Rate. 
Adam optimiser has been used post gradient descent. Beta 1 and Beta 2 have been kept at their usual values.
